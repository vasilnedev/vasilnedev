## Computer and IT technical skills 
I have had interests in computers along many years via experimenting, learning, reading and being curious how everything works. 

Most recently I have completed a bootcamp, which gives me a strong foundation in **Data Science** and **Python** for further development.

You can find some examples of my code in my public GitHub repositories.

To see my acheivements from the **Data Science** bootcamp, please visit:

Some **JavaScript** examples from my old work are demonstarted on YouTube at:
Introduction of process-based IMS - https://youtu.be/0QKQKj0xzjc
An idea for process digitalization with BPMN sever and custom front-end application - https://youtu.be/NLdZyCcYQAc

Some online courses that I have completed are listed in my **PluralSight** profile:
